# genomesignals

A collection of types of genomic signals different people plot

- Topology weight, a signal showing the match to a particular evolutionary tree topology across the genome https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-1938-2/figures/6
- Conservation score e.g. phastCons, phyloP, from multiway alignments
- WGS alignment sequence depth, indicating CNV/DUP/DEL
- GC content, important for gene body, or sequencing bias
- GC skew, important for replication oriding
- ChIP-seq peaks, the sequencing depth enriched for transcription factor or histone binding to the DNA
- Tajimas D https://www.g3journal.org/content/6/9/2867 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajima%27s_D
- Genome-wide nucleotide diversity https://www.g3journal.org/content/6/9/2867
- Fixation index, for comparing two populations https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixation_index
